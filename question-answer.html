        <h1>1. Var, Let, and Const – What's the Difference? </h1>
        <p>While this assumption might be partially true, it's still possible that some of these features remain a mystery to some devs. One of the features that came with ES6 is the addition of let and const, which can be used for variable declaration. The question is, what makes them different from good ol' var which we've been using? If you are still not clear about this, then this article is for you. In this article, we'll discuss var, let and const with respect to their scope, use, and hoisting. As you read, take note of the differences between them that I'll point out.</p>

        <h1>2.The Difference Between Regular Functions and Arrow Functions</h1>
        <p>Arrow function — also called fat arrow function— is a new feature introduced in ES6 that is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. While both regular JavaScript functions and arrow functions work in a similar manner, there are certain differences between them.

          Understanding the differences between regular and arrow functions helps choose the right syntax for specific needs.

this value inside a regular function is dynamic and depends on the invocation. But this inside the arrow function is bound lexically and equals to this of the outer function.

arguments object inside the regular functions contains the list of arguments. The arrow function, on the opposite, doesn't define arguments (but you can easily access the arrow function arguments using a rest parameter ...args).

If the arrow function has one expression, then the expression is returned implicitly, even without using the return keyword.

        <h1>3.Difference Map , forEach, filter and find Short summary </h1>
        <p>The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by applying the callback function on each element of an array, while the forEach method doesn't return anything. You can use the forEach method to mutate the source array, but this isn't really the way it's meant to be used..
          The find() method is used to find all the descendant elements of the selected element. It finds the element in the DOM tree by traversing through the root to leaf. The filter() method is used to filters all the elements and returns the element that matches and the element that do not match are removed.
